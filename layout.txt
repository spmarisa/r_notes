for a share header and footer on all pages
The application.html.erb layout is applied to all controllers.

if you want a layout that only applies only to artcles controller should be created in
app/views/layouts/articles.html.erb
a controller attempts to use a layout that matches its name


<%= yield %> is where the content goes in application.html.erb
rails is all about convention over configuration 
here application.html.erb is automatically applied to all templates unless an alternate is specified. 
if you change the name of the layout as it stands, it wonâ€™t be automatically applied. 

class ExampleController < ApplicationController
  layout 'my_layout' # Will use a layout in app/views/layouts/my_layout.html.erb
end

You can include a layout for a specific action with an explicit call to render inside the action:
render :layout => 'my_layout'.

Sometimes, you want to render an action without a layout. In that case, you can pass false in
place of the layout name: render :layout => false.
