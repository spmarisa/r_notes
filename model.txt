MODEL - models in Rails correspond to database table names.



Article model expects a table named articles.
model names are camel-cased singular(ArticleImage) and correspond to lower-cased plural table names(article_images).

rails generate model
rails generate model NAME [field[:type][:index] field[:type][:index]] [options]
rails generate model Article title:string body:text published_at:datetime --skip-migration

rails generate model Article


VALIDATIONS

  validates :title, presence: true



A model contains all the logic that governs its citizenship in the world of your application. 
In the model, you can define how it interacts with other models. Models need to relate to one another
all the logic for a particular table is contained in one place: the model.

FAT model - Instead of performing model-related logic in other places you keep it in the model, thus making it fat and helps your code stay DRY

Rails convention, the foreign-key column is the singular, lowercase name of the target class with _id appended
the model that contains the “belong_to” needs to have the foreign key column in it.
