Two basic varieties of form helpers are available:

  FormHelper: Active Record–aware tag helpers for creating forms that hook into models.

  FormTagHelper: Helpers that output tags. They aren’t integrated with Active Record.
                 The names of these helpers are suffixed with _tag.


the advantage with FormHelper is that they know how to populate themselves with data and can automatically be highlighted in the event of validation errors


FormHelper - form_for, label, text_field, text_area, datetime_select, and submit.

The form_for helper is of the FormHelper variety. It creates an HTML form tag for the passed object (@article, in
this case) and places everything in the do..end block inside the resulting form.
