don’t repeat yourself (DRY) principle, and the you ain’t gonna need it (YAGNI)

Convention over configuration means that you need to define only configuration that is unconventional.

mvc pattern - model data - view ui - controller all actions

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

MODEL - active record- data access, associations, - lib that handles db abstraction and interaction
validations, calculations, and routines that should be executed before and after save, update, or destroy - info the application works with - represets database


CONTROLLER - Action controller  - director of interaction between model and view - controllers are responsible for rendering views -
in controller every method is called action
A library for manipulating both application flow and the data coming from the database on its way to being displayed in a view.


VIEW - action view - visual rep of ui - a templating sys that generates html
Any direct interaction with the model layer should be delegated to the controller layer, to keep the view clean and decoupled from the application’s business logic.
